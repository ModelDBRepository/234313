
To run simulation: 

1- Run 'parameters.m' to load parameters values.
2- Run 'BG.slx' which is the main simulation. Some '*.mat' files are created which contain information on the movements. 
3- To see the motions, run 'animation.m'.
4- To simulate parkinsonian condition, set g in 'parameters.m', lower than 1 and greater than 0.
